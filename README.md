This Java project implements a "brick breaker" game using object-oriented principles, featuring classes like Figure, ActiveFigure, Brick, Ball, and Player, all managed by a Scene that renders them on a Canvas. The system relies on multithreading to handle concurrent animationsâ€”each ActiveFigure (e.g., moving balls or falling bricks) operates in its own thread, enabling smooth, non-blocking updates while the main thread processes user input (keyboard/mouse events). Threads synchronize to ensure safe access to shared resources, such as collision checks or figure removal, and are efficiently managed by the Scene to start/stop all animations collectively. This design ensures responsive gameplay, with physics (e.g., bouncing, velocity changes) and visual updates running independently, demonstrating core OOP concepts (inheritance, polymorphism) alongside practical thread management for real-time interactions.
