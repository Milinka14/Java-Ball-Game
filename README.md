This Java project implements an object-oriented graphical simulation inspired by a classic "brick breaker" game. The system consists of several key classes representing interactive elements: Figure (base class for graphical objects), ActiveFigure (animated figures), Brick (destructible targets), Ball (a projectile with physics), and Player (a paddle controlled by keyboard input). The Scene class manages these elements on a Canvas, handling collisions, movement, and rendering. The ball bounces off bricks (which turn gray and fall when hit) and the player’s paddle, while the player can shoot balls and move horizontally within the scene’s bounds. The simulation adheres to principles of inheritance, polymorphism, and event-driven design.

Purpose & Context:
Developed as part of an academic assignment for an Object-Oriented Programming 2 course, this project serves as the foundation for a subsequent lab exercise. It demonstrates core OOP concepts like encapsulation (e.g., figure properties), abstraction (e.g., ActiveFigure extending Figure), and dynamic behavior (e.g., collision handling). The code is structured to be modular, allowing easy extension for future features. Note that while this submission is ungraded, it will be expanded upon in the lab evaluation.
